# Automated Academic Query Management System

## Description
The **Automated Academic Query Management System** is a comprehensive solution designed to streamline the management of academic queries using an automated rule-based reasoning engine. Developed using **Java Swing** for the user interface and **JDBC** for database interactions, the system automates query processing with **Drools** for efficient rule-based reasoning, providing fast and accurate responses to academic-related inquiries.

## Key Features
- **Automated Query Handling:** Automatically processes academic queries with predefined rules using Drools.
- **User-Friendly Interface:** Built with Java Swing to provide an intuitive interface for both students and administrators.
- **Rule-Based Reasoning Engine:** Leverages Drools for automated reasoning and decision-making based on academic query patterns.
- **Database Connectivity:** Uses JDBC for secure and efficient interaction with the backend database.
- **Scalable & Customizable:** Supports additional rules and easy modifications for future enhancements.

## Technology Stack
- **Frontend:** Java Swing
- **Backend:** Java, JDBC
- **Database:** MySQL (or any relational database)
- **Rule Engine:** Drools (for rule-based reasoning)
- **Version Control:** Git

## Prerequisites
